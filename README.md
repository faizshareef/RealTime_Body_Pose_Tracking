# RealTime_Body_Pose_Tracking
Real-time human body pose tracking system using MediaPipe and OpenCV for skeletal landmark detection and motion analysis.

##📌 Project Overview

This project implements real-time human body pose tracking using MediaPipe and OpenCV. It detects 33 body landmarks from live webcam input and visualizes the human skeletal structure dynamically.

The system can be extended for:

 ->Exercise tracking

 ->Rep counting

 ->Posture correction

 ->Motion analysis

 ->Fitness monitoring
